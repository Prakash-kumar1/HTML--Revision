    <!-- Question no. - 1 =>> What are the semantic tags?
Answer => The HTML semantics refers to the tags that provide meaning to an HTML page rather than just presentation.

<!-- Question no. - 2 =>> What are meta tags in HTML?
Answer => The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is information about data.
